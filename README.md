# U.S. Detour

A curated collection of
authentic,
high-quality,
well-designed products,
all made in the United States.

## Mission

Our mission is to tell the real story of products:
how, why, and by whom they&rsquo;re made.
The history of the manufacturers,
intricacies of form and function,
with focus on the act of creation,
quality craftsmanship,
and timeless design.

We want to shift attention to realities,
over trite advertising fictions.

We see an alternative to
the parade of hollow brands,
the bogus hyped virtues and features,
the derisive assertions that your life is incomplete without some thing.

We&rsquo;re surrounded by multitudes of stuff,
undergoing an unprecedented historical shift from scarcity to plenty.
This abbundance is overwhelming;
with so many options,
deciding has become the difficulty.
Why choose one over another?
Price? Appearance? Perceived quality?

We believe where it comes from and how long it&rsquo;ll last matters more.

Initially we&rsquo;re merely offering a collection of products,
with simple descriptions and straightforward layout.
As we grow, we&rsquo;ll present more about producers and their products,
showing how and where they&rsquo;re made,
what you can do with them,
and their place in history.

## Design

We started out with a single product on a single page,
added products until hitting the limit of that one page,
and now have close to 100 products, across 11 pages.

Since everything comes from America,
we&rsquo;re including the specific state where the item was produced.

Country of origin [affects consumers&rsquo; evaluation of product attributes]
(http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3172608?uid=3739712&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21105286754253),
and we&rsquo;re curious to explore higher-resolution
&ldquo;supply-side marketing.&rdquo;

## Implementation

Check out the HTML&mdash;it&rsquo;s more minimal than Tim Berners-Lee&rsquo;s
[first webpage](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).
I&rsquo;ve tried to isolate only the minimum necessary markup features,
from HTML ["1.2"](http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt) to 5.1.

I&rsquo;ve&rsquo;nt held back on using contemporary CSS features
(e.g. there are media queries)
but most of the design has been in terms of typography,
focused on long-term usability over passing prettiness.

Though TBL [didn&rsquo;t intend HTML to be written directly](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Weaving/Overview.html)
[*Weaving the Web*, first edition, page 42],
that was how I got into software development,
back in junior high, around the turn of the millennium.
After spending the better part of this decade hacking MEAN and LAMP,
it&rsquo;s been thoroughly refreshing to focus exclusively on design and content,
suppressing my impulse to abstract and encapsulate and otherwise prematurely automate.
